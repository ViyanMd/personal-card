## Acknowledgments

Linke most of the challenges for newbies, this one was easy to make, but the result looks great. For some reason the last deployment failed, 
so you won't be able to see the latest "version", but the difference is not that big (In the last version there's min-width for the container to prevent 
overlapping on extremely narrow screen that might not exist in real life).
